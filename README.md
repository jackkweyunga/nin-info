# NIN Info finder

A site to help you find your details as registered by NIDA. Only detail needed is your NIN. Meant for those who have forgotten some of their details and need them.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Disclamer

It is not an official site. Just made to help those who may have forgotten some of their details.
